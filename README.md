20,000 Leagues Over the Sea
======================

I was the president of SIGGD and lead game programmer for this project. I spent the majority of my time managing both the programmers and artists. I was in charge of importing models and textures created by the artists into the game and worked on core gameplay systems like player respawning, planet health and random planet and background generation.

I worked on the following files:
Attacks subdirectory
Player subdirectory
Menu subdirectory
Enemies subdirectory
colliders subdirectory
Orbit.cs
Projectile.cs
RandomizeBackgroundTexture.cs
LanderCollision.cs
PlanetRotate.cs
